The narrative takes place within perhaps a month[note 1] before the first events of the frame story in The Name of the Wind. It's centered on Bast during a single day in Newarre. Bast's charming and alien nature is made apparent as he manipulates and helps several of the villagers children, often by using Fae magic. It particularly focuses on his assistance of the child Rike, whom he helps rid of an abusive father, despite the fact he has broken Bast's rules of conduct, quoted below:

"No one taller than the stone.
Come to blacktree, come alone.
Tell no adult what’s been said,
lest the lightning strike you dead."
―Viette Lant reciting the rules
Kote is present, but a minor character in the story.
